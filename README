Module for magento 2.1, which indexes products to elasticsearch. Does not contain any frontend implementation, because this module is mainly created for my magento-react project.

* How to install module

As this module is not listed in Magentos marketplace, you need to install it manually from github. Note, this will mess with your composer.json files "repository" section. Make sure you have original file stored in safe place.

composer config repositories.0 vcs https://github.com/mcfizh/elasticindexer
composer require mcfish/elasticindexer

Now you can restore composer.json files repository section from backup.

To make the module actually do something, run the following commands on magentos root:

php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
