Module for magento 2.1, which indexes products to elasticsearch. Does not contain any frontend implementation, because this module is mainly created for my magento-react project.

* How to install module

Copy content of src folder to folder 'app/code/McFish/ElasticIndexer', also copy the whole vendor folder to ElasticIndexer folder. Note you must copy the vendor folder, not it's content.
